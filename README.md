## The xyflow mono repo

The xyflow repository is the home of three packages: React Flow `reactflow`, Svelte Flow `@xyflow/svelte` and a shared helper library `@xyflow/system`. The package name of React Flow will change when we have a stable v12 (probably by beginning of 2024). Until then the current version (v11) of React Flow lives on the v11 branch and is still supported of course. 

* React Flow `reactflow` version v11 is on branch v11
* Svelte Flow `@xyflow/svelte` can be found under [packages/svelte](./packages/svelte)
* React Flow v12 (not published yet) can be found under [packages/react](./packages/react)

## Key Features

- **Easy to use:** Seamless zooming and panning, single- and multi selection of graph elements and keyboard shortcuts are supported out of the box
- **Customizable:** Different node and edge types and support for custom nodes with multiple handles and custom edges
- **Fast rendering:** Only nodes that have changed are re-rendered 
- **Hooks and Utils:** hooks for handling nodes, edges and the viewport and graph util functions
- **Plugin Components:** Background, Minimap, Controls and a Panel
- **Reliable**: Written in Typescript and tested with Cypress and Playwright


## Getting Started

The best way to get started is to check out the [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/learn) or [Svelte Flow](https://svelteflow.dev/learn) learn section. However if you want to get a sneak peek of how to install the and use the libraries you can see it here:

  <summary><strong>React Flow</strong> basic usage</summary>

  ### Installation
  
  ```sh
npm install reactflow
  ```

  ### Basic usage
  ```jsx
import { useCallback } from 'react';
import ReactFlow, {
  MiniMap,
  Controls,
  Background,
  useNodesState,
  useEdgesState,
  addEdge,
} from 'reactflow';

import 'reactflow/dist/style.css';

const initialNodes = [
  { id: '1', position: { x: 0, y: 0 }, data: { label: '1' } },
  { id: '2', position: { x: 0, y: 100 }, data: { label: '2' } },
];

const initialEdges = [{ id: 'e1-2', source: '1', target: '2' }];

function Flow() {
  const [nodes, setNodes, onNodesChange] = useNodesState(initialNodes);
  const [edges, setEdges, onEdgesChange] = useEdgesState(initialEdges);

  const onConnect = useCallback((params) => setEdges((eds) => addEdge(params, eds)), [setEdges]);

  return (
    <ReactFlow
      nodes={nodes}
      edges={edges}
      onNodesChange={onNodesChange}
      onEdgesChange={onEdgesChange}
      onConnect={onConnect}
    >
      <MiniMap />
      <Controls />
      <Background />
    </ReactFlow>
  );
}

export default Flow;
```

  <summary><strong>Svelte Flow</strong> basic usage</summary>

  ### Installation
  
  ```sh
npm install @xyflow/svelte
  ```

  ### Basic usage
  ```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { writable } from 'svelte/store';
  import {
    SvelteFlow,
    Controls,
    Background,
    BackgroundVariant,
    MiniMap,
  } from '@xyflow/svelte';

  import '@xyflow/svelte/dist/style.css'
  
  const nodes = writable([
    {
      id: '1',
      type: 'input',
      data: { label: 'Input Node' },
      position: { x: 0, y: 0 }
    },
    {
      id: '2',
      type: 'custom',
      data: { label: 'Node' },
      position: { x: 0, y: 150 }
    }
  ]);

  const edges = writable([
    {
      id: '1-2',
      type: 'default',
      source: '1',
      target: '2',
      label: 'Edge Text'
    }
  ]);
</script>

<SvelteFlow
  {nodes}
  {edges}
  fitView
  on:nodeclick={(event) => console.log('on node click', event)}
>
  <Controls />
  <Background variant={BackgroundVariant.Dots} />
  <MiniMap />
</SvelteFlow>
```
