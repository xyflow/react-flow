        Hello! :sparkles: You found the place to submit a bug or issue that you discovered in the xyflow library, thank you for helping us out!

        Having trouble making something work in xyflow, but it‚Äôs not a bug with the library itself? You‚Äôll get the fastest response by asking in [github discussions](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/discussions) or our [discord server](https://discord.gg/RVmnytFmGW).

        **Search our [discussions](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/discussions?discussions_q=) and [issues](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/issues?q=)** to see if your problem has already been reported and you can add more context, or see if someone else has already solved your issue. And of course, check our [docs](https://reactflow.dev/learn) if you haven‚Äôt already.

        **Issue with the xyflow Docs?** Submit an issue in our [web repo](https://github.com/xyflow/web/issues) instead.

        With that out of the way, let‚Äôs get started :bug:
