Svelte Flow is a highly customizable component for building interactive graphs and node-based editors, built by the creators of React Flow. **Svelte Flow is still alpha and currently under heavy development. The API is relatively stable but some things might change.**

## Key Features

- **Easy to use:** Seamless zooming and panning, single- and multi selection of graph elements and keyboard shortcuts are supported out of the box
- **Customizable:** Different [node](https://svelteflow.dev/examples) and [edge types](https://svelteflow.dev/examples/edges/edge-types) and support for custom nodes with multiple handles and custom edges
- **Fast rendering:** Only nodes that have changed are re-rendered 
- **Hooks and Utils:** [Hooks](https://svelteflow.dev/api-reference/hooks) for handling nodes, edges and the viewport and graph [helper functions](https://svelteflow.dev/api-reference/utils)
- **Plugin Components:** [Background](https://svelteflow.dev/api-reference/components/background), [MiniMap](https://svelteflow.dev/api-reference/components/minimap) and [Controls](https://svelteflow.dev/api-reference/components/controls)
- **Reliable**: Written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and tested with [Playwright](https://www.playwright.dev)

## Installation

The easiest way to get the latest version of Svelte Flow is to install it via npm, yarn or pnpm:

```sh
npm install @xyflow/svelte
```

## Getting started

You only need a few lines to get a fully interactive (e.g. select and drag nodes or pan and zoom) flow. If you want to learn more, please refer to the [learn section](https://svelteflow.dev/learn), the [examples](https://svelteflow.dev/examples) or the [API reference](https://svelteflow.dev/api-reference).

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { writable } from 'svelte/store';
  import {
    SvelteFlow,
    Controls,
    Background,
    BackgroundVariant,
    MiniMap,
  } from '@xyflow/svelte';

  // you need to import the styles for Svelte Flow to work
  // if you just want to load the basic styleds, you can import '@xyflow/svelte/dist/base.css'
  import '@xyflow/svelte/dist/style.css'
  
  // We are using writables for the nodes and edges to sync them easily. When a user drags a node for example, Svelte Flow updates its position. This also makes it easier to update nodes in user land.
  const nodes = writable([
    {
      id: '1',
      type: 'input',
      data: { label: 'Input Node' },
      position: { x: 0, y: 0 }
    },
    {
      id: '2',
      type: 'custom',
      data: { label: 'Node' },
      position: { x: 0, y: 150 }
    }
  ]);

  // same for edges
  const edges = writable([
    {
      id: '1-2',
      type: 'default',
      source: '1',
      target: '2',
      label: 'Edge Text'
    }
  ]);
</script>

<SvelteFlow
  {nodes}
  {edges}
  fitView
  on:nodeclick={(event) => console.log('on node click', event)}
>
  <Controls />
  <Background variant={BackgroundVariant.Dots} />
  <MiniMap />
</SvelteFlow>
```
